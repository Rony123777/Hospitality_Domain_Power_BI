Key matics
__________

RevPar = Revenue Per Available Room ( Total room per totalroom available to sell )
rooms nuber could be chagne as some rooms could be in maintenence

available rooms

Occupency occ% =Total Rooms occupied / Total rooms available 
*like for example on monday 50 people checkout so 50 rooms available out of 100 so occ is 50%

ADR    = Average Daily Rate
Total Rooms Revenue / Number of Rooms sold
50 rooms for 1000rs adr=1000 

SRN    = sellable Room Nights ()
lets suppose we have 100 rooms are available so for the month of june 
we have 30 days so we can sell 100*30=3000 rooms per the month
so SRN will be 3000

DSRN =Daily SRN=3000/30 per day SRN

Realization
URN =  Utilized Room Nights
if we have a 100 room hotel and 100 available rooms and 
on Sunday 50 rooms were booked and the customer stays those would be called 50 URN

BRN = (Booked Room Nights) =URN + No shows + Cancelation
100 room hotel 60 booked for staying and 50 ended up staying

Realization = URN/BRN
how many customer actully stayed that will be the actual revenue generates

* No shows and cancelation are accounted differently

When we take business decesions we look ate data movement 
by weekly and monthly trends


channel level trends like bookmyshow or many
level 1,2,3
